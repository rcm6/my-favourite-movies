# My Favourite Movies App

## Group Project

Our project involves utilising two APIâ€™s to collect data for our user, who intends to search for movies that they are interested in - being able to view details about the movie searched for from data returned from OMDB API and via video content gathered from Youtube's API.   

Our end-user is a movie enthusiast and throughout the years has watched countless numbers of movies that they have found needing to keep a track of. 

Our end-user wants a way to get the latest popular movies available without having to subscribe to a service, our end-user also needs a way to favourite a movie they have searched for. 

Our user wants to be able to view the details of the movie. 

## Usage

There is a main search box, where a user can search for any movie. They are presented with the following results from the OMDB API: 
- Name of movie
- Movie Poster 
- Year of release
- Plot

Once the movie is returned successfully, the user is able to choose from a series of links to related YouTube clips. 
These include trailers, reviews, actors and soundtracks and using the YouTube API a selection of 6 videos are displayed at the bottom of the page.
 
Search history is stored using local storage, and updates to include the 6 most recently searched for movies. Users can also add movies to their favourites list, which is unlimited in length.

Modals are used to display errors in case of a missing or not found movie name in the search box, or no favourites stored. 

Modals are also used to display the results of a current search or favourie clicked.



Here is a mock up of the page:
